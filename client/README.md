## Sending Server-Side Requests Locally
When sending requests to the server-side **locally**  you can add `/api` to the relative path and it will then automatically redirect to the port you are running the server-side on (currently it assumes that the server-side runs on localhost:5000, but maybe it has to be updated if we integrate the front-end with the back-end).
